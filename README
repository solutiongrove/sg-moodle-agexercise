A moodle plugin that provides ability to map a Khan Academy exercise to an activity

This is a beta release and has been tested on Moodle 2.1.1.

This plugin requires the sg-moodle-agbase plugin (https://github.com/solutiongrove/sg-moodle-agbase)

Copy the agexercise directory under your moodle install's mod directory.
Once installed and enabled there will be a new activity "AG Exercise" that teachers can
add to their courses.  Sample video of usage: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InVL1vFh-_4
